# Housing Analysis

Hi there. My name is Rob. I'm creating ths repo because I have a background in economics, currently work in the finance industry, however am passionate about topics in economics that impact everyday people and how the study and analysis can maybe shed light on human behavior, policy impacts, and how continue to move social progress forward and increase living standards for all people. That seems very lofty, and surely this won't make a lick of a difference, but it at least helps me use the skills that I have to learn, to teach, and to inform. I'm not sure about the final layout of this project just yet. I'm drafting that over time, but will fill in the blanks as I get to them.

Therefore, in this project, my focus is on housing. It's a hot topic as currently (back-half of 2024) we are in one of the most difficult periods for obtaining housing in the US. Supply is low, prices are very high, there's commentary on the barriers to building including policy, infrastructure, space, and climate change. There's conversation concerning the rent or own decision and what those tradeoffs are. My goal is to gather information from a wide array of sources and share that here and help inform the answer to the question: 

**"What's up with the housing market?"**
