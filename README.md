# Housing Analysis

Hi there. My name is Rob. I'm creating ths repo because I have a background in economics, currently work in the finance industry, however am passionate about topics in economics that impact everyday people. I'd like to use some of my skills to study and conduct analysis that can maybe shed light on human behavior, policy impacts, and to continue to move social progress forward and increase living standards for all people. That seems very lofty, and surely this won't make a lick of a difference, but it at least helps me use the skills that I have to learn, to teach, and to inform. I'm not sure about the final layout of this project just yet. I'm drafting that over time, but will fill in the blanks as I get to them.

Therefore, in this project, my focus is on housing. It's a hot topic as currently (back-half of 2024) we are in one of the most difficult periods for obtaining housing in the US. Supply is low, prices are very high, there's commentary on the barriers to building including policy, infrastructure, space, and climate change. There's conversation concerning the rent or own decision and what those tradeoffs are. My goal is to gather information from a wide array of sources and share that here and help inform the answer to the question: 

**"What's up with the housing market?"**

This README will outline the following things:

## How To Use This Project:
* How to run and install


## Data Sources and General Timing Of Updates:

  ### US Census Bureau:
  * **American Community Survey (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/about.html):**
  The American Community Survey (ACS) is an ongoing survey that provides vital information on a yearly basis about our nation and its people. Information from the survey generates data that help inform how trillions of dollars in federal funds are distributed each year. Through the ACS, we know more about jobs and occupations, educational attainment, veterans, whether people own or rent their homes, and other topics. Public officials, planners, and entrepreneurs use this information to assess the past and plan the future. When you respond to the ACS, you are doing your part to help your community plan for hospitals and schools, support school lunch programs, improve emergency services, build bridges, and inform businesses looking to add jobs and expand to new markets, and more.

  * **Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) Data (https://ffiec.cfpb.gov/):**
  The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) requires many financial institutions to maintain, report, and publicly disclose loan-level information about mortgages. These data help show whether lenders are serving the housing needs of their communities; they give public officials information that helps them make decisions and policies; and they shed light on lending patterns that could be discriminatory. The public data are modified to protect applicant and borrower privacy. HMDA was originally enacted by Congress in 1975 and is implemented by Regulation C.
